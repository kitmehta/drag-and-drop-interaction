- Demonstrate the **creation of interactive learning content**.  
- Showcase the use of **variables, triggers, and slide layers** in Storyline.  
- Provide a **fully functional HTML5 game** that can be hosted online.  
- Serve as a **resume-ready project** to demonstrate technical proficiency in e-learning development.

## How It Works
1. Users **drag an item** from the source area.  
2. Drop it into the **corresponding target area**.  
3. The project checks correctness using **Storyline triggers and variables**.  
4. Correct placement triggers **feedback animations or messages**.  
5. Users can proceed to the next interaction until the activity is complete.  

> All interactions are built entirely in **Articulate Storyline**, exported to HTML5 for browser compatibility.
